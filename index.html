                    In 1912 one of the greatest minds was born. England, London. Son of Julius Mathison Turing and Ethel Sara Turing. They
                    were very strict parents towards Alan. At the time people would try to fit the good and normal way of life of other
                    families that ran the region to be accepted by them and have a better chance to have a job. Alan Turing’s parents were
                    very serious and molded Alan just for a chance to fit in. This could be why Alan was so afraid to express himself. He
                    was an introvert and was bullied in school, he had no friends and became cold and isolated. At the age of 16 in 1928 he
                    made a friend called Cristopher, his first and best friend. Both were studying hard, and mainly on math, to get good
                    grades, Turing since he was a kid always had an inclination towards math and numbers.
                    
                    In the year 1930, At the age of 18 he started to having feelings towards his friend Cristopher, Alan Turing was gay, and
                    his desires to tell cristopher were huge but at the time, being gay was considered illegal and a crime. He wrote a
                    letter for Christopher confessing his feelings towards his best friends and sent him. Next day morning he arrived at
                    school and received the news that his friend had died, which destroyed Alan inside. Even after the immense tragedy, Alan
                    was always focused on the studying of math and sciences and possibly what kept him sane at the time.
                    
                    After he graduated at the school of Sherborne Turing studied at King's College, Cambridge where he was awarded
                    first-class honors in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22. He proved the Central Limit Theorem. In 1936 published one
                    of his most important articles - “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem”.
                    
                    In 1950 he developed the “Turing Test”. whose goal is defined as the standard through which machines can be considered
                    intelligent. At the moment a human couldn’t distinguish if they were talking with a machine or a human,that machine
                    could be considered intelligent.
